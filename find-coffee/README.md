# Idea for workshop

The app:

- Location based application.
- Serverless function that serves location coords to nearby coffee
- Static frontend hosted on S3 that puts the coords on the map around you


What the workshop user will do:
 - Hook the function code up to api gateway in a serverless file. Explain how serverless events work...
 - Point an static front end to s3 deployment with a serverless plugin.
 - Set the api url up in the frontend
 - Set open maps api keys as environment variables or maybe use aws secrets manager
